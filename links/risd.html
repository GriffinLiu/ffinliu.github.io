         <p class="proj-subhead" id="risd-bg">Background</p>
         <p>Since its establishment, RISD Museum has undergone several identity revisions. However, I felt that its
            current identity still lacked awareness and consistency. The logo, only visible on a handful of posters
            outside the museum and a few pages on the website, wasn’t standardized across the museum’s materials. Many
            are even unaware that a logo exists.As part of my graphic design studies at the Rhode Island School of
            Design, I completed a rebranding for RISD Museum with the intention of exploring the field of branding while
            further familiarizing myself with Adobe design softwares. </p>
         <p class="proj-subhead" id="risd-goal">Goal</p>

         <p>
            Create a new identity systi of RISD Museum that can:
            <br> 1.Be applied to a wide range of materials to make it immediately <i>recognizable</i>
            <br> 2. Establish a place in <i>memories</i>
            <br> 3. <i>Reflect</i> the museum's brand
            <br>To achieve this goal, I divided my design process into six steps-follow along below!</p>

         <p class="proj-subhead" id="risd-process">1.Research</p>
         <p><i>Goal:understand the client needs to develop an appropriate
               visual language.</i>
            <br>To construct a well-defined identity, I first need to understand RISD Museum as a whole. I presented
            myself
            with the following guidelines to carry out my research of the museum, and created a moodboard to present all
            my findings. Sources I used (apart from Google of course) ranged from the museum’s official site, interviews
            with museum staff & RISD faculties, online reviews, to personal visits (multiple times, shoutout to free
            student admissions!).I also examined current identity to find out what I like & want to change.

         <p class="proj-subhead">2.Discovery</p>
         <p><i>Goal:identify elements/images to use in the development of the identity
               .</i>
            <br>After the initial research, I performed a visual distillation with the goal of generating keywords that
            I
            want to focus on during my design.I generated 5 final keywords, then organized my data, in the form of
            images or texts, according to their relevance to these keywords.

            I used a wordcloud to visualize the most occurring words in the museum’s mission & values, which I can use
            in my logo design as guidelines. I also noticed recurring elements of juxtaposition in multiple categories
            of my initial research, from how the museum displays both student’s hand-drawn work and ancient Greek
            sculptures to how the museum’s modern exterior stands out from its neighboring New England buildings.</p>

         <p class="proj-subhead">3.Extraction</p>
         <p><i>Goal:develop a logo that communicates the essence of RISD museum to the public.
            </i>
            <br>This is where my keywords come into play! Using them as guidelines, I looked into how I can extract the
            potential of visuals in their respective categories to eventually develop a graphic symbol, by working them
            into type, integrate textures, apply colors & image…the list goes on.

            I performed 3 rounds of iterations, each time creating 15 variations of the same logo. At the end of each
            iteration, I asked 5 different individuals for feedback whose backgrounds ranged from professors, museum
            employees, to international students.

         <p class="proj-subhead">4.Standardize- set theme</p>
         <p>Inspired by the texture of letterprint machine, I decided to combine a variety of grunge brush strokes

            Color- give off a celebratory feeling
            Type: Franklin Gothic, bold while being clean and legible display, good for headlines
