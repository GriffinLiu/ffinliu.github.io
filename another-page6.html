      I make paintings that embody placidity through a process of adding and subtracting from surface and materials. This acts as a physical manifestation of impermanence in Buddhism
      <br/>and the beauty of imperfection — values that come from the aesthetics of traditional Korean culture, and which lead to the pursuit of meditation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In Korean culture, embracing imperfection means respecting nature by accepting natural forms. A state of imperfection proposes as a value the progressive search for a perfect,<br/> unreachable, state. Impermanence, an idea from Buddhism, states that nothing in this earth is ever free and everything always changes and alternates. One thing dissolves into another <br/> through a perpetual process of cause and effect. The characteristics of incompleteness and decay complete the painting and it takes on as subject the notion of incompleteness, which <br/> evokes in me the core spiritual practice of accepting impermanence.

      Living within nature, I encounter its beauty everyday through collecting sands, rocks, leafs, and dusts. To keep the true state of beauty, With Hanji’s  warmth and delicate texture, <br/> I seal the collected nature to keep in a precious manner.  The act of sealing the collected nature is a daily practice of meditation, and each bookmark then becomes a daily record <br/>of my life to remember the moment of beauty I discover everyday. I seek to provide relaxing and serious moments within which both the viewer and I can meditate and be introspective. <br/> My work becomes a visual metaphor for my mind as it progressively searches for who I am, and thus achieves emotions such as serenity, relief, and peacefulness.
